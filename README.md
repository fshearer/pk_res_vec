# R code to generate species distribution maps of vectors and reservoirs of *P. knowlesi* malaria  

The code directory contains the R code used to run analyses for the manuscript *The spatial distributions of the macaque hosts and mosquito vectors of *Plasmodium knowlesi* malaria and their relationship with forest cover*, currently under review.

The main script is `master_script_reservoirs.R` which names the R packages required and calls the other scripts in order.
The package `seegSDM` can be downloaded from the `SEEG-Oxford` github repository of the same name.
this repsoitory is not fully reproducible but enables reviewers and readers to scrutinise the methods in detail.
